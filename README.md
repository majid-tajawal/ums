This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App]


In the project directory, you need to run following commands to get the project running on your local machine.

### `npm install`

This will install all the depnedencies. 

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in the browser.
I have changed the default port 3000 to 3001 as our backend server runs on this port.
